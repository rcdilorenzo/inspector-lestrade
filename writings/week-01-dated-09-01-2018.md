# [MSDS 686] Week 1 Eye Tracking Update (Sep 1, 2018)

## Completed Tasks
- Did a bit of reading on the format of GazeCapture data set
- Moved GazeCapture data set to my internal SSD to faster access
- Finished going through "[Deep Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python)" course from DataCamp
- Started and completed "[Convolution Neural Networks for Image Processing](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing)" course from DataCamp
- Began small experiment to write a neural network on my own to classify MNIST numbers (will keep in GitHub repository)
- Looked a bit at Tensorflow and found the wonderful [visualization library TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard); I'll probably use this in my project with keras to more easily track the performance of various model architectures.

## The Week Ahead
- Finish classification experiment with MNIST with keras
- Visualize experiment with TensorBoard for more interactive feedback
- Exploratory data analysis on available data to determine what's available and potentially useful
- Do learning on how to partially re-use existing NNs like ResNet50 as a basis for a custom network
- Determine how to do object detection (as opposed to simply classification) with CNNs (or Deep Learning in general)

## Notes
- I already have a Deep Learning development workstation ready to go. I built a custom i7700k Quad-Core 4.2GHz, 64 GB DDR4–3200, NVIDIA 1080 Ti, 1 TB SSD build (Ubuntu w/ Gnome) specifically for data science and have tensorflow configured to use the GPU.
- As I proceed, I plan to reference Francois Chollet's book *Deep Learning with Python* to ensure that I have a proper grasp on how to do things properly in keras.

Looking forward to the week ahead!
